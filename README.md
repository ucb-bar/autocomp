**✏️ Authors**: [Charles Hong](https://charleshong3.github.io/), [Sahil Bhatia](https://x.com/sahilb17), [Alvin Cheung](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~akcheung/), and [Yakun Sophia Shao](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ysshao/) (UC Berkeley)

### What is Autocomp?

Autocomp is an LLM-driven code optimizer for tensor accelerators. Autocomp is designed to be portable and easy to use across a variety of hardware targets, and has already demonstrated strong performance on an industry accelerator ([AWS Trainium](https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/trainium/)), an academic accelerator ([Gemmini](https://github.com/ucb-bar/gemmini)), NVIDIA GPUs, and even the RISC-V Vector Extension.

### How does Autocomp work?

Autocomp decomposes the optimization problem into a beam search, where each iteration is further divided into a planning phase and an implementation phase. Autocomp applies the user's domain knowledge, along with a variety of techniques to successfully explore the search space, in order to iteratively improve the code. For more details, see our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18574).

# ⚙️ Setup

## Hardware Target Setup

Autocomp can currently optimize code for the following hardware targets:
- AWS Trainium ([trn_setup.md](autocomp/backend/trn/trn_setup.md))
- Google TPU ([tpu_setup.md](autocomp/backend/tpu/tpu_setup.md)) — uses a [built agent](autocomp/agent_builder/README.md) (`built:tpu-v6e`)
- Gemmini ([gemmini_setup.md](autocomp/backend/gemmini/gemmini_setup.md))
- CUDA via KernelBench ([kb_setup.md](autocomp/backend/kernelbench/kb_setup.md))
- CUDA via GPU MODE ([gpumode_setup.md](autocomp/backend/gpumode/gpumode_setup.md))

> **Note:** Not all hardware targets have a handcrafted agent in `autocomp/agents/`. Some targets (like TPU) use agents created by the Agent Builder, stored in `autocomp/agent_builder/.built/`. These work the same way — just set `agent_name = "built:<name>"` in `search.py`.

Partially supported hardware targets:
- RISC-V Vector (RVV) on Canaan Kendryte K230. See `k230` branch for code. As the implementation is very hacky, we do not currently recommend using this hardware target.

For instructions on adding a new hardware target, see [ADDING_HARDWARE_SUPPORT.md](ADDING_HARDWARE_SUPPORT.md).

### 🏗️ Agent Builder (Recommended for New Hardware Targets)

The recommended way to add a new agent is with the **Agent Builder**, which automatically creates a hardware-specific agent from documentation sources (local directories, PDFs, and webpages):

```bash
pip install "autocomp[agent-builder]"

python -m autocomp.agent_builder.run_agent_builder \
    --agent-name my_accelerator \
    --source-dir path/to/docs \
    --agent-scope "Optimizing kernels for MyAccelerator using the XYZ programming interface."
```

For detailed usage, CLI options, Python API, and output format, see [Agent Builder documentation](autocomp/agent_builder/README.md).

## LLM Setup

Autocomp supports both local and remote endpoint LLM inference. For local inference, we support vLLM's [OpenAI-compatible server](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/serving/openai_compatible_server/). For endpoint inference, we support a variety of providers (see below).

### Local Inference with vLLM

1. **Install and launch vLLM:**
   ```bash
   pip install vllm
   vllm serve --model Qwen/Qwen3-8B --port 8000 -tp <number of GPUs>
   ```

2. **Configure Autocomp:**
   Set `models`/`code_models` in `search.py`:
   ```python
   models = ["vllm::Qwen/Qwen3-8B"]
   ```
   Optionally set `VLLM_API_BASE` if using a different host/port (default: `http://localhost:8000/v1`).

3. **Multiple models on different ports:**
   You can serve multiple vLLM models on separate ports and use them together by encoding the base URL in the provider string with the format `vllm@<base_url>::<model_name>`:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1
   vllm serve --model Qwen/Qwen3-8B --port 8000 -tp 1
   # Terminal 2
   vllm serve --model meta-llama/Llama-3-70B --port 8001 -tp 4
   ```
   ```python
   models = [
       "vllm@http://localhost:8000/v1::Qwen/Qwen3-8B",
       "vllm@http://localhost:8001/v1::meta-llama/Llama-3-70B",
   ]
   ```

For more details, see the [vLLM documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/).

### LLM Endpoint Setup

API keys can be configured via environment variables or in `autocomp/common/keys.py`. Environment variables take precedence over the keys file. The variable names in `keys.py` match the corresponding environment variable names.

**Supported keys:**

| Provider | Environment Variable / Key Name | Provider Name in `search.py`
|----------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| OpenAI | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `openai`
| Anthropic | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `anthropic`
| Together | `TOGETHER_API_KEY` | `together`
| AWS Bedrock | `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION` | `aws`
| Google Cloud | `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` | `gcp`

**Example `autocomp/common/keys.py`:**

```python
OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-..."
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "sk-ant-..."
TOGETHER_API_KEY = "..."
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "AKIA..."
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "..."
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION = "us-central1"
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT = "my-project"
```

Keys can be omitted if not needed. On startup, Autocomp logs which keys are available.

#### Gemini Setup

To use Gemini via Google Cloud, install the Google Cloud CLI as described at https://docs.cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk#linux.

Run `gcloud auth application-default login` to enable the Google Cloud SDK.

#### AWS Bedrock

Anthropic (Claude) models on Bedrock use the native Anthropic SDK adapter. All other Bedrock models (e.g., GLM, DeepSeek, Kimi) are supported via the Bedrock Converse API. Any model available in your Bedrock region can be used by passing its Bedrock model ID:

```python
models = [
    "aws::us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-5-20251101-v1:0",  # Claude (Anthropic adapter)
    "aws::zai.glm-4.7",                                 # GLM 4.7
    "aws::deepseek.v3.2",                               # DeepSeek-V3.2
    "aws::moonshotai.kimi-k2.5",                        # Kimi K2.5
]
```

By default the `us-west-2` region is used. Set the `AWS_REGION` environment variable (or add it to `keys.py`) to override.

## 🚀 Usage

`autocomp/search/search.py` is the entry point for running Autocomp optimization. Various parameters such as hardware target, models used, beam size, number of plans, number of code implementations, dropout, etc. can be configured here.

Notable parameters:
- `backend_name`: The hardware target to use. Currently supported values are `trn`, `tpu`, `gemmini`, `kernelbench`, and `gpumode`.
- `agent_name`: The LLM agent type to use. For new hardware targets, use a built agent: `"built:<name>"` (e.g., `"built:tpu-v6e"` for TPU). See the [Agent Builder docs](autocomp/agent_builder/README.md). Handcrafted agents are also available for existing targets (`trn`, `gemmini`, `cuda`).
- `hw_config`: A hardware configuration object describing the target hardware. Examples:
  - `TrnHardwareConfig("trn1.2xlarge")`
  - `TpuHardwareConfig("v6e-1")`
  - `GemminiHardwareConfig(pe_dim=16, spad_size_kb=256, acc_size_kb=64)`
  - `CudaHardwareConfig("NVIDIA L40S", "2.5.0", "12.4")`
- `models`: The list of models to use. Models are specified `"<provider>::<model>"`, for example `"openai::gpt-5.2"` or `"gcp::gemini-3-pro-preview"`. Currently supported endpoint providers are OpenAI (`openai`), Google Vertex AI (`gcp`), Anthropic (`anthropic`), AWS Bedrock (`aws`), and Together (`together`). Use provider `vllm` for local serving.
- `code_models`: The list of models to use for the implementation phase of prompting, if you would like to use a distinct set of models from planning. Can be set to `None` to use the same set of models.
- `simulator`: The evaluation method to use, if multiple are supported.
  - For Trainium, doesn't matter (put `None`)
  - For TPU, doesn't matter (put `None`)
  - For Gemmini, `spike` (only optimizes instruction counts, not cycle counts) or `firesim`
  - For CUDA/KernelBench, doesn't matter (put `None`)
  - For CUDA/GPU MODE, `gpumode-local` or `gpumode-cli`
- `iterations`: The number of iterations to run.
- `search_strategy`: The search strategy to use. Currently only `beam` is supported.
- `num_plan_candidates`: Number of plans (strategies) generated per parent candidate per iteration. Default `4`.
- `num_code_candidates`: Number of code implementations generated per plan. Default `2`.
- `beam_size`: Number of candidates kept in the beam after each iteration. Default `4`.
- `dropout_menu_options`: Probability of dropping each strategy menu option from the prompt, encouraging diversity. Default `0.25`.
- `prob_type`: The problem type to use.
  - For Trainium, `trn-tutorial` or `trn-advanced`.
  - For TPU, `tpu`.
  - For Gemmini, `gemm`, `conv`, or `admm-multifunction`.
  - For CUDA/KernelBench, `kb-level1`, `kb-level2`, `kb-level3`, or `kb-level4`.
  - For CUDA/GPU MODE, `gpumode`.
- `prob_id`: The problem ID to use.
- `translate_iters`: Number of initial iterations that use translation strategies (converting code to the target representation) instead of optimization strategies. Defaults to `0` (no translation). Only works on supported agents. Built agents load strategies from `translate_menu.yaml`; see [Agent Builder docs](autocomp/agent_builder/README.md#translation-support).
- `translate_perf_threshold`: During translation iterations, candidates are kept if their score is within this factor of the best score (e.g., `1.2` means up to 20% worse).
- `translate_score`: If `True`, score translation candidates by code similarity to the original (how complete the translation is), not just latency. Defaults to `True`.
- `translate_drop_original`: If `True`, drop the original (untranslated) candidate from the beam after the last translation iteration. Defaults to `True`.
- `resume_from`: Path to a previous run's output directory. Loads the final candidates from that run as the starting beam (e.g., to optimize after a translation-only run).
- `early_stop_iters`: Stop after N iterations without improvement (0 = disabled).
- `reimplement_failed`: Re-generate code for candidates that failed evaluation (only works on supported agents).
- `menu_strategy`: For `BuiltLLMAgent` only. Set to `"one-shot"` to dynamically generate new strategies per candidate via an LLM call, or `None` for static menu only.
- `fine_grained_isa`: For `BuiltLLMAgent` only. Enables two-level ISA filtering (section then subsection) to include only relevant ISA documentation in the prompt.
- `example_rate`: For `BuiltLLMAgent` only. Per-example probability of including an LLM-selected code example in the planning prompt.
