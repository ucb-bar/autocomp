# Autocomp: LLM-driven Code Optimization for Tensor Accelerators

Note that this repository is still under construction. 

`autocomp/search/search.py` can be used to run Autocomp for GEMM and convolution benchmarks, but TinyMPC kernels (stored under the name `admm-multifunction`) require manual changes to the code.

Setup instructions coming soon.
